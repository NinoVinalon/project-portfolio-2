The Color Game is a simple yet innovative game that people of all age will enjoy. The site will target
anyone from toddlers who are at home enjoying their tablet/ipad to people working in the office looking to
take a break from few minutes from their dreadful day.

The game itself requires no complex action to function. Players only need to pick and guess any color
that game board might display. At the start of the game, the player will be given 50 points. Any correct
guess will merit 50 points and a deduction of 10 points for any incorrect guess.
